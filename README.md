# Ensuring Data Privacy in Federated Learning

*A cloud-deployed, end-to-end system demonstrating privacy-preserving machine learning using Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and AWS.*

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project addresses a critical challenge in modern AI: *how can we collaboratively train a machine learning model on sensitive, decentralized data without compromising individual privacy?*

We demonstrate a complete, functional solution by building a system that trains a neural network on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The architecture ensures that raw data never leaves the client device, and mathematical guarantees of privacy are enforced through Differential Privacy. The entire system‚Äîfrom the federated server to the live metrics dashboard‚Äîis deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), showcasing a real-world, scalable implementation.

## 2. Core Concepts

### Federated Learning (FL)

Instead of pooling sensitive data into a central server, the model is sent to the data.

**Analogy:** Imagine a group of hospitals wanting to build a better diagnostic model. Instead of sharing confidential patient records, a central coordinator sends a copy of the AI model to each hospital. Each hospital trains the model on its own private data and sends back only the mathematical learnings (model updates). The coordinator then averages these learnings to create a smarter, global model.

**Implementation:** We use the *Flower (flwr)* framework to manage this process, with a central server orchestrating the training rounds with multiple clients.

---

### Differential Privacy (DP)

Provides strong, mathematical guarantees that the contribution of any single individual is protected.

**Analogy:** After each hospital trains its model, it adds a carefully calibrated amount of statistical "noise" to the learnings before sending them back. This noise makes it mathematically impossible for an attacker to reverse-engineer the updates to learn anything about a specific patient.

**Implementation:** We use the *Opacus* library from PyTorch. It automatically adds noise and clips the influence of individual data points, providing a measurable privacy guarantee known as *epsilon (Œµ)*. A lower epsilon means stronger privacy.

## 3. System Architecture

The project is composed of three main parts:

```plaintext
[ FL Clients ]  --> Train on local data using Opacus and send updates
        |
        v
[ FL Server ]  --> Aggregates updates using FedAvg
        |
        v
[ Metrics Writer ] --> Stores performance + Œµ to S3
        |
        v
[ FastAPI Metrics API ] --> Reads metrics from S3
        |
        v
[ React Frontend ] --> Displays graph of training progress
```
![Diagram](/images/working%20flow.png)

### Components:

1. **Federated Learning Backend:**
    - `server.py` ‚Äî Orchestrates the training process.
    - `client.py` ‚Äî Simulates client training with Differential Privacy.

2. **Metrics & Monitoring:**
    - `metrics_writer.py` ‚Äî Writes training results and Œµ to Amazon S3.
    - `metrics_api.py` ‚Äî FastAPI server that aggregates metrics from S3.

3. **Frontend Dashboard:**
    - A modern web application built with *React and Vite*.
    - It fetches the combined data from the Metrics API and renders a real-time graph visualizing the training progress, showing how accuracy, loss, and epsilon change over the federated rounds.

## 4. AWS Cloud Deployment Architecture

We deploy this architecture fully on AWS:

### ‚úÖ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Hosts: `server.py`, `client.py`, and `metrics_api.py`
- **Config:**
  - t3.micro instance
  - 30 GB EBS volume
  - 2 GB swap file to handle PyTorch installs

### ‚úÖ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- *metrics-bucket:* for JSON logs of each client
- *frontend-bucket:* static site hosting for React dashboard

### ‚úÖ Amazon KMS (Key Management Service)
- Encrypts all client metric files with a custom KMS key

### ‚úÖ AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Role: `FlowerProjectEC2Role`
- Grants EC2 permission to write to S3 and use KMS

### ‚úÖ Security Groups
- Open ports:
  - `22` ‚Äì SSH
  - `8080` ‚Äì FL server
  - `8000` ‚Äì FastAPI API

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment (Summary)

1. **Create IAM Role** `FlowerProjectEC2Role`  
   - Attach `AmazonS3FullAccess` + `KMS` access policies

2. **Create KMS Key**  
   - Allow your IAM role to use it

3. **Launch EC2 Instance**  
   - Use t3.micro
   - Add `30 GB` storage
   - Configure `security group` for ports 22, 8080, 8000
   - Attach the IAM role
